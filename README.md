# PlottingTemplate

This is a simple template for plotting results with matplotlib. This file sets up a custom number of rows and coloumns and then plots based on those rows. After importing data in the python script there is a place to put the x and y labels for each of the plots. From there, you specify the plot for each row including changing the legend label.
